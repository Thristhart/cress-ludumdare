    <p id="goal">
      The goal of Cress is simple: get one of your pieces to the other side of the board. Once a player moves their piece off the board on the enemy's side, they win.

    <p id="actions">
      There are three basic actions in Cress.
    </p>
    <p id="move">
      <h2>Move</h2>
      Pieces can move forward one square. <br />
      To move a piece, simply click on your piece and click a square ahead of it. Pieces cannot move onto already occupied squares.
    </p>

    <p id="jump">
      <h2>Jump</h2>
      Pieces can jump forward, left or right two squares. <br />
      However, pieces become "tired" after jumping, and cannot take an action for two turns after jumping. <br />
      To jump a piece, simply click on your piece and click a square to jump to. Pieces cannot jump onto already occupied squares.
    </p>

    <p id="tired">
      Notice that the piece indicates how many turns are left until it is usable again.
    </p>

    <p id="kill">
      <h2>Kill</h2>
      Pieces can kill an enemy to their immediate left or right. <br />
      However, killing an enemy piece causes the killer to go back as far as possible in their row. <br />
      To kill a piece, simply click on your piece and click on an enemy to the left or right of it.
